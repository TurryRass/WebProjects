for the syntax of css:

selector(property:value)

no selector is where or whose means kaha or kiska in hindi.
property is what you want to apply or chnage to the selctor.
and value is what should the chnage be .

p(color:blue) compare with the syntax

fonts are good in html and for css.# simple line just to remind of me about fonts.


span can be used if we want to highlight some word.by fiving instructions to it.


em will multiply the character in a word height and make it that much down from the line before it.


now a question is text align and how it works:
see text align put the text wheee the user wants;
when left all the first words of the line are in a  sytematic way;same for right but in right direction ,when center then text is in center but the text will not be made straight in left or right then theirn is justify which will do justice by putting both of them in a way that in left and right both the words are in staright line.that is it about text-align.
