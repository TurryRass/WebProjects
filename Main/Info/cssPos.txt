there are four types of positions in css :
1.static:it is the default way of position setting starting from the screen:
2.relative:this make the element change its poistion relative to its previous position.if you say left:5px then it will move 5 pixels from its original or now position.due to this it will create a space or gap in its original position.
absolute:this will change the element position to its parent element position{that is element in which it is in.}
fixed:it will fix the object in that position itself where it has been told and will not move at all.
sticky:it will make something stick on the screen and will not move from the default position and will look like it has sticked.
to move in different directions after setiing the position use:
left,right,top,bottom{this will change the postion from the bottom.}
